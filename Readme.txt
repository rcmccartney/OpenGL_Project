DEPENDENCIES:

Need to have SOIL for image loading and matclpro for matrix operations (both supplied by the professor to the class). 
Also need glut and glew to use OpenGL with C++.

This is an object-oriented, small framework for OpenGL.  It allows for new models to be defined and loaded at 
runtime, rather than be hard-coded into the source.  It uses classes and inheritance to be as reusable as possible within
the confines of OpenGL.
